Notes: This example uses auto-detect mode on the tool as no ACTS input file is supplied (only test cases
       in .csv file). The "-P" option specifies that parameter names are at the top of the .csv file.
       
       This will take awhile to finish since we are generating missing combinations up to
       100% coverage for all 2,3,4,5 way interactions. Generating the missing 5-way interactions will take
       the longest. It is recommended to add the "-p" option to speed things up.
